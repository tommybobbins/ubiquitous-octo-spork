<P>What would you do to save the life of your child?</P>
<P>Anything, everything.</P>
<P>James Calhoun, soldier until the MOD cutbacks threw him onto civvie street. Back into it as a military contractor,  making more money in a week than he had in a year as a squaddie it seemed like the good times would never end.   
Now divorced and living on benefits in a one room flat, rock bottom after a downward spiral of anger and bitterness,  his one solace is the weekly visit with his daughter. 
He has been told that she will die and only he can save her.
But is the price more than he is willing to pay? </P>
