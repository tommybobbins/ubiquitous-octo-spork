<P>Joe Mansour always wanted to be a writer, but found that life got in the way. OK, fair enough, being a Jack of all trades but a Master of procrastination prevented him from doing much about it. A change in circumstances gave him the opportunity (and the resolve) to actually knuckle down and write a book - the first of what he hopes are many.</P>
<P>A modest man (he has much to be modest about - Churchill), he finds self promotion to be, while not physically painful, moderately uncomfortable. However he does feel that his books are worthy of merit (he felt a bit dizzy then at such self-aggrandizement). His books are good, his mum has said so and she can't even read! *</P>
<P>* She can read.</P>
